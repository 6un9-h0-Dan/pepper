            Thank you for taking the time to apply to {{ config.EVENT_NAME }}. Unfortunately, we are unable to offer you 
            a spot this year. This decision is not a reflection of your resume or your experience level. While we wish we could accept
            everyone who applied, there's a limited amount of space and it wouldn't be fun for anyone if it got too crowded.

            If you are local to Austin, TX, we are still looking for volunteers and mentors to help us out. If you are interested in
            serving in either capacity, please fill out <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/4enbcuIAD8MTOkpn2">this form</a> and we'll get
            back to you soon.

            you to continue learning and creating amazing things.
