                        Here are the responsibilities that you will need to fulfill in order to receive travel
                        reimbursement, which is capped at $50:

                            Be a point of contact for your university and help other hackers out.

                        <li>
                            We will share your email and Facebook account link with all the hackers
                            from your university that were accepted.
                        </li>

                            Answer questions about how a hackathon works and help to organize travel logistics.

                        <li>
                            Follow the MLH Code of Conduct. Be gracious, kind, and inclusive to other hackers.

                            If there are multiple campus ambassadors from your university, please get in contact with
                            them
                            and see if you can organize separate carpools in order to maximize the number of hackers
                            from
                            your university.

                    <p>Thank you for taking the time to apply to be a campus ambassador. Unfortunately, the applicant
                        pool
                        was
                        very competitive and there were limited spots open at different universities. We will not be
                        able to
                        offer you a spot as a campus ambassador.</p>
                    <p>
                        Here are are some of the factors for our decision that we found to be relevant across most
                        applications:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lack of experience in hackathons. We want campus ambassadors to be able to answer questions
                            from
                            their
                            fellow students about hackathons. If you have never been to a hackathon before, we chose
                            another
                            candidate who had more hackathon experience.
                        </li>
                        <li>We did not offer any UT Austin students the position of campus ambassador because the
                            Freetail
                            Hackers
                            Outreach team (which organizes HackTX) already fulfills these duties. Campus Ambassadors are
                            only given
                            to universities outside of UT Austin. If youâ€™d like to be more involved in outreach for
                            HackTX,
                            please
                            apply to join our organizer team in December.
                        </li>
                        <li>Other applicants seemed to have larger reach in the community and took the time to explain
                            how
                            they
                            supported their hacker community and first-timers.
