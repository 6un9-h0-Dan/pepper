                <p>Thank you for taking the time to apply to {{ config.EVENT_NAME }}. Unfortunately, we are unable to offer you 
                    a spot this year. This decision is not a reflection of your resume or your experience level. While we wish we could accept
                    everyone who applied, there's a limited amount of space and it wouldn't be fun for anyone if it got too crowded.</p>
                <p>If you are local to Austin, TX, we are still looking for volunteers and mentors to help us out. If you are interested in
                    serving in either capacity, please fill out <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/4enbcuIAD8MTOkpn2" class="decorate">this form</a> and we'll get
                    back to you soon.</p>
                <p>Thanks again for your interest! We would love to see you apply again next year, but in the meantime, we highly encourage 
                    you to continue learning and creating amazing things.</p>
