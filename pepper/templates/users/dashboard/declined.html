            <p>Sorry you couldn't make it this year, {{ user.fname }}! Unfortunately, once an invitation has been
            declined, we are unable to change your status. We'd still love to have you join us as a volunteer or mentor.
            If you are interested in serving in either capacity, please fill out
                <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/4enbcuIAD8MTOkpn2" class="decorate">this form</a> and we'll get
            back to you soon.</p>
            <p><a href="https://freetailhackers.com" class="decorate">Freetail Hackers</a> will also be hosting a spring
                hackathon that we hope you join us for.</p>
